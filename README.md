## Challenge Overview
Tom and Seth require help analyzing election audit results to the election commission. Utilizing Python scripts, the objective is to extract the election results from a csv file to print to a command line and to save to a text file.

## Challenge Summary
Working from the `election_results.csv` file, use conditional & non-conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. These results will be printed to the command line and subsequently saved in the text `election_results.txt` file.
